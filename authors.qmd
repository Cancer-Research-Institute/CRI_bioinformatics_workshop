**Nataly Naser Al Deen, Ph.D.** is currently a Senior Computational Biologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, leading the efforts on Spatial Transcriptomics Techniques (mainly Visium HD) in pre-malignant lesions, including in ovarian cancer (serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC)) and gastric cancers (signet ring cell (SRC) carcinoma). She is a wet-lab cancer researcher by training (10 years) and recently shifted to computational oncology during her second postdoctoral fellowship in cancer immunotherapy and melanoma research at Dr. Antoni Ribas’ Lab at UCLA (2022-2024), focusing on spatial biology techniques to study tumor-immune interactions from patients with melanoma who underwent immune checkpoint blockade therapies. Prior, she completed a 2-year postdoctoral fellowship in cancer genomics at the Ding Lab at Washington University School of Medicine (WashU), where she led the single cell and single nuclei RNA/ATAC-sequencing technologies, Visium spatial transcriptomics and 3D Lightsheet Microscopy, focusing on breast, pancreatic, renal cell carcinoma, and metastatic colorectal cancers (wet-lab), and was part of the HTAN, CPTAC, and SenNet consortia. She obtained her Ph.D. in Cell and Molecular Biology from the American University of Beirut and received three fully-funded scholarships from the United States Department of State including the Fulbright Scholarship to Georgetown University where she obtained her M.Sc. in Tumor Biology. Through her parallel passion for science policy, advocacy, and activism for the rights of minority and indigenous populations, she founded an NGO in 2015 called "Pink Steps", to serve as an exercise, health and mental-wellness support group for breast cancer survivors in Lebanon and was named on Forbes 30 Under 30 List for her humanitarian work. In 2018 she represented Lebanon at the 68th Lindau Nobel laureate Meeting in Physiology/Medicine and collaborated with Nobel Laureates on several panels including for research and science policy. She then served as the only Global Academic Fellow to the Precision Medicine Council at the World Economic Forum in 2019 and as an expert member at the Public Policy Projects UK’s Global Genomics Roundtables, Phase 2 in 2022-2024.

**Katie Campbell, Ph.D.** is an Adjunct Assistant Professor at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Her research is at the intersection of cancer biology, immunology, and bioinformatics, integrating these methodologies to study how melanoma responds to immunotherapy. Leveraging high-dimensional spatial profiling and bulk sequencing modalities, her work aims to discover resistance mechanisms that stratify patients and inform the next generation of precision oncology strategies. Katie earned her undergraduate degree in biochemistry at the Penn State University and her PhD in molecular cell biology at Washington University in St. Louis. Her training, research, and career have been supported by NIH NCI T32 training programs at Washington University in St. Louis and UCLA, the Cancer Research Institute Irvington Postdoctoral Fellowship, the Gil Nickel Melanoma Research Fellowship through the V Foundation and UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy and V Foundation Bridge Fellowship, and the Melanoma Research Alliance-Ressler Family Fund Young Investigator Award. In addition to her research, Dr. Campbell is actively involved in mentorship and professional development, having served five years and elected Chair of the Associate Member Council of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR), and research and patient advocacy, through the AACR and the Melanoma Research Foundation.
