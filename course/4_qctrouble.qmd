# Common challenges

## *NaN* and missing data

Dealing with missing data and NaN (Not a Number) values is a common challenge in R programming. These values can affect the results of your analyses and visualizations. It's essential to handle missing data appropriately, either by imputing them or excluding them from the analysis, depending on the context.

**Example**: 
```R
# Creating a dataframe with missing values
df <- data.frame(
  x = c(1, 2, NA, 4),
  y = c(5, NA, 7, 8)
)

# Check for missing values
sum(is.na(df))
```

## Missing packages or dependencies

When running R code, you may encounter errors related to missing packages or dependencies. This occurs when you try to use functions or libraries that are not installed on your system. This will commonly look like a red error stating "There is no package..." Installing the required packages using *install.packages("package_name")* can resolve this issue.

```R
# Trying to use a function from an uninstalled package
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) + geom_point()
# Error: there is no package called 'ggplot2'
```

There are two main package repositories within the R ecosystem, CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) and Bioconductor. Natively `install.packages()` will look only in CRAN, there is a separate function to install packages from bioconductor. 

```R
# Instructions for Bioconductor to install the "GenomicRanges" library
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("GenomicRanges")
```

Copy/paste right from bioconductor will install the package, however to give a bit of an explanation of what is going on in the instructions above, you are first installing the "BiocManager" package from CRAN which is a bioconductor maintained package to install packages from the bioconductor itself. the `if` block is just saying to install "BiocManager" only if it is not already installed. The second piece of code works `BiocManager::install()` works as `install.packages()` just searching the bioconductor package repository, you might notice the `::`. This is a somewhat advanced R topic but you will often see it on stackoverflow or other help message boards. It simply is a way to refer to a funciton within a package without explicitly loading that package via the `library()` function.

# Where do I go for help?

## Stack Exchange

Online communities like Stack Exchange, particularly the Stack Overflow platform, are excellent resources for getting help with R programming. You can search for solutions to specific problems or ask questions if you're facing challenges. If you attempt to Google what you're trying to accomplish with your dataset, StackExchange often includes responses from others who may have gone through this effort before. With the open crowdsourcing of troubleshooting, these responses that work for others are "upvoted" so that you can try to adapt the code to work for your dataset. Importantly, take care to change the names of variables and file paths in any code that you try to implement from others. 

## ChatGPT

ChatGPT is an AI assistant that can provide guidance and answer questions related to R programming. You can ask for clarification on concepts, debugging assistance, or advice on best practices. If you copy/paste an error into ChatGPT, it often tries to debug without any other preface. However, if you try to explain exactly what your code is trying to accomplish, it can be a helpful way to debug your help.

## Good practices

##Commenting your code
Adding comments to your code is crucial for making it more understandable to yourself and others. Comments provide context and explanations for the code's functionality, making it easier to troubleshoot and maintain.

## Publicly accessible resources

### Github

Github hosts numerous repositories containing R scripts, packages, and projects. Browsing through repositories and contributing to open-source projects can help you learn from others' code and collaborate with the R community. This can be a direct way to make your code available upon publication, according to journal practices.

# How do I apply the code I've learned to my own data?

Once you've learned R programming basics, applying the code to your own data involves understanding your data structure, identifying relevant functions and packages, and adapting example code to suit your specific analysis goals.


```R
# Example: Applying code to your own data
# Load your dataset
my_data <- read.csv("my_data.csv")

# Explore the structure of your data
str(my_data)

# Identify relevant variables and features
# HINT: Use colnames() and tidyverse functions to clean up your data

# Perform analysis or visualization using appropriate functions and packages
# HINT: Use ggpubr functions to parallelize statistics across groups

# Adapt example code to suit your data and analysis goals
# HINT: Try different methods of plotting. Consider what important features you're trying to understand and show with this data.

# Comment your code for clarity and future reference
# HINT: Make your life easier when it comes time for reproducing your figures and filling in that "Data and Code Availability" section of your manuscript.
```
