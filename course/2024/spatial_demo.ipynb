    "There are many methods for cell enumeration, including counting the number of cells of each cell type, calculating cell frequency by dividing by the total number of cells, and calculating cell density by dividing by the total tissue area. While the first approach is the most straightforward, simply counting the number of cells depends on the amount of tissue present in the image. Cell frequencies normalize the number of each cell type to the total number of cells in the image such that all cell types sum to 1. As a result, cell frequencies are not confounded by differences in the size of the section. However, one drawback of cell frequencies is that they can obscure the reason that the amount of one cell type differs between samples. For example, consider a simple example of comparing the number of tissue resident macrophages in healthy and inflamed tissue. Even if the number of macrophages is the same in both images, it may seem like tissue resident macrophages are decreasing in the latter relative to the former. In reality, however, the absolute count of tissue resident macrophages is not changing; they are just outnumbered by infiltrating immune cells. Only considering cell frequencies in such a scenario would lead to the incorrect conclusion that macrophages are decreasing in the inflamed state. One solution is to also examine the density of each cell population by dividing by the total tissue area.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we are showing an example of two FOVs that have different amounts of immune infiltrate, ECM content, and total area (as determined using the slide background mask). We have generated masks of the ECM (using the composite signal of ECM markers) and empty sllide (for MIBI, we can determine empty slide by measuring gold signal, since we use gold sputtered slides). Using the empty slide mask, we can estimate tissue area (by taking the inverse). In the ECM and empty slide masks shown here, white indicates ECM or empty slide, respectively."

    "The goal of pairwise enrichment analysis is to assess whether any two given cell populations colocalize with each other. For example, this approach could be used to determine if T cells preferentially colocalize with tumor cells. In asking such questions, we recommend taking this one step further: Do two cell populations colocalize with each other more often than would be expected by chance? Depending on the frequency of the cell populations and native tissue structure, it may not be possible to determine whether some pairwise relationships are truly preferential or random. The goal of this approach is to minimize potential confounding effects specific to each image that might not be related to the biological question of interest. For example, in a tissue section equally composed of only two cell populations, pairwise enrichment is likely to occur simply by random chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, we can assess the statistical significance of pairwise enrichment by comparing how often two cell populations are found in close proximity to each other compared with a null distribution. To construct a null distribution, we use a bootstrapping approach by selectively randomizing the location of the cell populations of interest, calculating pairwise enrichment, and repeating this process a large number of times (>100 times is typical). In the assessment of preferential enrichment for two cell populations defined by their expression of marker A or B, the simplest way to generate a null distribution is to randomize the location of one cell population across all cells in the image while keeping the location of the other cell population fixed. For both the original and randomized images, cells positive for A or B are colocalized if the distance between them is less than or equal to a user-defined value. The number of A–B interactions in the original image is then compared with the null distribution to determine statistical significance."

    "This randomization strategy is robust for mitigating confounding effects attributable to the frequency of each cell population. However, this approach does not control for biases inherent to tissue structure. Consequently, interactions between two proteins may appear to be spatially enriched as a result of tissue structure or cell-specific expression, as markers expressed exclusively by certain cells will be heavily influenced by the location of those cells. For example, two immune cell populations that are known to preferentially localize in germinal centers are biased to be enriched with each other. While one possibility is that this relationship is indeed preferential, another possibility is that spatial enrichment is merely a result of both cell types being restricted to a smaller histological compartment.\n",

    "To address this possibility, null distributions can also be generated in a context-dependent manner. In context-dependent spatial enrichment analysis, randomizations are restricted to occur only within a given cellular compartment or cell subset. In the germinal center example, randomizations can be restricted to occur only within the germinal center. As a result, spurious enrichments that might occur between noninteracting cell populations that happen to colocalize to germinal centers are accounted for in the null distribution.\n",

    "Cell phenotypes are regulated in part by their local cellular niche, or microenvironment, which is defined as a collection of cell lineages found to be spatially colocalized and conserved across the data set. We can employ several methods to identify these microenvironments. The first step in this process is to quantify the local distribution of cell lineages around each cell in the data set. Here, we are enumerating the number of cells in each lineage within a set pixel radius from the index cell. Various machine learning methods can then be used to identify distinct cellular microenvironments that occur repeatedly across the data set. Here, we are using k-means clustering."
