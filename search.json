This format is characterized by having: - Multiple rows, each corresponding to a single observation or measurement. - One column for the variable being measured. - Additional columns to store metadata or grouping variables.\nAdvantages: - Facilitates easy analysis and manipulation, especially when using tools like Tidyverse packages in R. - Suitable for data that follow the “one observation per row” principle, such as time series or longitudinal data.\n\n\nWide Format\nIn the wide format, each observation is represented by a single row, but with multiple columns corresponding to different variables. This format is characterized by: - One row per observation. - Each variable is represented by a separate column.\nAdvantages: - Can be easier to understand for simple datasets with few variables. - May be more convenient for certain types of analysis or visualization.\n\n\nChoosing Between Long and Wide Formats\nThe choice between long and wide formats depends on factors such as the nature of the data, the analysis tasks, and personal preference. Long format is often preferred for its flexibility and compatibility with modern data analysis tools, while wide format may be suitable for simpler datasets or specific analysis requirements.",

We will perform these activities on the RStudio Server, available through the Posit Cloud platform. - Posit Cloud account: You should have received access to Posit Cloud through a link to your email address. If you did not receive this link, please contact @ for a new one. Logging into the workspace, using this email address, will provide access to all course materials and allow for data analysis through RStudio Server on your internet browser. - Laptop computer: Please bring your own laptop with internet capability. Since the workshop will take place through Posit Cloud, the interface will be accessed through an internet browser. Google Chrome is recommended.\nWhile the Introduction to R programming (Days 1-2) is is designed for all skill levels, having a basic understanding of R programming may enhance your learning experience. If you are new to these areas, consider reviewing one or a few of the following introductory materials prior to the workshop.\n\n\nDuring the course\nOver the course of the workshop, teaching assistants (TAs) will be working with small groups of attendees during the hands-on exercises. Feel free to direct your questions to the them, the instructors, or the Slack channel.\n\n\nAfter the course\n\nR: In order to utilize the RStudio Desktop application from your laptop (and not through the browser), you will first need to install the latest version of R. [link]\nRStudio Desktop can be downloaded here [link]. Note that this functions in the same manner as the RStudio Server by Posit Cloud, but utilizes the storage and compute of the laptop machine itself. Laptops vary in memory and storage space, which can dictate the speed and capability of data analysis, and this may result in slower processes with large datasets.\n\n\n\nWorkshops and vignettes\n\nSingle Cell Best Practices\nRNA-seq Bioinformatics\nPrecision Medicine Bioinformatics\nOrchestrating Single-Cell Analysis with Bioconductor"
